=====

A calculator backed by a forth-based language

Some goals:

* Complex numbers are handled nativly
* Rational numbers are handled nativly
* Vectors and Matricies shouldn't be pains
* Dates and date intervals supported
* Built-in constants and unit conversions
* Using and Programming the calculator via a calculator keypad shouldn't be terribly time consuming

My end goal is to have this be a library that'll back two programs

* Java-based command line calculator
* Android-based programmable calculator app
